# Overview

This is a day planner that loops through the hours of 9 am to 5 pm for today's date. I used day.js to handle time. My day planner also allows you to save the text in any hour field. The past hours will be highlighted grey, the current hour redm and the future hours green. 


# Essential Criteria 

I have applied the essential criteria as follows:

* When I open the planner, the current date is displayed at the top of the calendar
* When I scroll down
* Then I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
* When I view the timeblock for the day
* Then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future
* When I click into a timeblock, then I can enter an event
* When I click the save button for that timeblock
* Then the text for that event is saved in local storage
* When I refresh the page, then the saved events persists. 

## Mock-Up
